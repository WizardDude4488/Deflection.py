Hello! Welcome to my game project called _Deflection_.

It's a one player vs computer or two player game.
The goal is to deflect randomly spawned blue particles, and hit gold particles for points.
The game ends when the other player is hit by a blue particle.
Enjoy!

Unfortunately there isn't an executable file of the game available at this time, however, the game can be played from an editor by running the full script in main and downloading the other files, making sure to put everything in the same folder.
